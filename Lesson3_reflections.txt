When would you want a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- if you want to share your work with others
- if you are collaborating with others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Use a fork to copy a repository from another gitHub user, but before you're sure you want to commit their changes
- Use a branch on your local machine to represent a new feature or experimentation that you want to work on separately from your main code.
- Clone when you want to make an exact copy of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually?
- If someone made changes and pushed them to GitHub, they would be automatically implemented onto your local version without your knowledge. That might not be something you like.
