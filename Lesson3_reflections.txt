When would you want a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- if you want to share your work with others
- if you are collaborating with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually?
- If someone made changes and pushed them to GitHub, they would be automatically implemented onto your local version without your knowledge. That might not be something you like.
