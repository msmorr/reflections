Using diff to find Bugs:
It's really challenging to find bugs manually, so diff is valuable in identifying both what changed
and what stayed the same after editing code.

Using history for efficiency:
Having easy access to the entire history of the file can help me track changes and go back to previous versions
without having to re-do code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit?
We have more control over when to commit to the history of the file with manual commits.
We can make the commits as large or as small as needed.

Why do you think some version control systems allow saving 

How can I use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of a file?
- You can use git log to check the commits made to a file
- You can use git diff to analyze a commit to see what changed in that particular commit.

With Git, you can explore and experiment without fear of breaking the whole project. If it introduces a bug, you can always go back to a previous version.

I want to use Git to make sure I'm as efficient as possible as I'm learning to program.
